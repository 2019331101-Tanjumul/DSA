Big O Notation:

To find the sum from 1 to N:

Solution 1: Formula: N(N+1)/2
Solution 2: For loop from 1 to N

These two methods may perform differently on different machines (one may be faster than the other), but to compare algorithms universally, we use Big O notation.

Big O notation describes how the runtime or space requirements grow as the input size increases.

Examples of Big O Notation:

y(n) = 3n^2 + 5n      ---> O(n^2)
y(n) = n + 100logn    ---> O(n)
y(n) = 3n^3 + 4n^5    ---> O(n^5)
y(n) = 1000000000     ---> O(1)
